# Superposition

It is the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until measured.

## The basics

The principle of quantum superposition states that if a physical system may be in one of many configurations—arrangements of particles — then the most general state is a combination of all of these possibilities, where the amount in each configuration is specified by a complex number. 
In the Quantum Game, you can observe this as what looks like a photon splitting into more photons, but these are just all the possible 
states of the photon at this particular time.
