# Interference

A phenomenon in which two waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same amplitude.

## The basics

Constructive and destructive interference result from the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same frequency. Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, light, radio, acoustic, surface.
