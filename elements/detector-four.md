# Photon Detector x 4

It detects any photon which is incident on it by transforming it into an electrical signal.

_It is a four-headed plant. Very devourous!_

```{quantum-board}
{
  "cols": 4,
  "rows": 3,
  "cells": [
    {
      "coord": { "x": 0, "y": 1 },
      "element": "Laser",
      "rotation": 0,
      "frozen": true
    },
    {
      "coord": { "x": 3, "y": 1 },
      "element": "DetectorFour",
      "rotation": 180,
      "frozen": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## In-game usage

Works like a detector, but accepts incoming light from all directions.
