# Photon Detector x 4

It detects any photon which is incident on it by transforming it into an electrical signal.

_It is a four-headed plant. Very devourous!_

```{quantum-board}
  {
    "cols": 4,
    "rows": 3,
    "cells": [
      {
        "coord": { "y": 1, "x": 0 },
        "element": "Laser",
        "rotation": 0,
        "frozen": true,
        "active": true
      },
      {
        "coord": { "y": 1, "x": 3 },
        "element": "DetectorFour",
        "rotation": 180,
        "frozen": false,
        "active": false
      }
    ]
  }
```

## In-game usage

Works like a detector, but accepts incoming light from all directions.
