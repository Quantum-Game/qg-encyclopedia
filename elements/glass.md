# Glass

Light travels slower in a glass, so it retards a wavepacket (vs if it were traveling in the air).

## Basics

Glass has a refractive index of around 1.5, meaning that light travels a slower speed (2/3 c).
Some special glasses have an even higher refractive index, up to 2.

## Going deeper

To delay 700nm light (red) by lambda/4 you need only 0.35 µm of glass at n=1.5. It is just half of its wavelength in the vacuum.

In the laboratory, we delay phase by subtler (and more accurate) means.
