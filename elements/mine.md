## Basics

It detects the presence of a photon. Note that if there is amplitude 1/sqrt(2), there is 50% probability of the bomb exploding.
A bomb cannot "sense" a part of amplitude, either the photon localizes there (and we are done) or not.

## Digging deeper

Depending on your worldview, either there is a random chance that the bomb explodes or not (e.g. in the Copenhagen interpretation of measurement), or there are two equivalent worlds - one in which it explodes, and one in which it does not (e.g. in the many-world interpretation by Everett).

## Trivia

Yes, it is a homage to the classic Minesweeper.
