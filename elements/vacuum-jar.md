## The basics

The refractive index of air is 1.000293 (at 0 def of Celcius, and 1atm pressure), which means that in the air it takes light 0.0293% more time to travel the same distance.

## Digging deeper

For the wavelength of 700nm (red) it would take around 0.6mm of vacuum to shift its phase by lambda/4.
