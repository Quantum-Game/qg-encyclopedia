# Polarizing Beam Splitter

It reflects vertically-polarized light and passes horizontally-polarized light.

## The basics

A cube made of two pieces of birefringent materials, that is, ones that have a different refractive index for horizontal and vertical polarization.

## In-game

We use cubes for polarizing beam-splitter, and thin pieces of glass for non-polarizing beam-splitters.
The reality is more complicated, as both setups can work, for polarizing or non-polarizing.
