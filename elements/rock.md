# Rock

It blocks light and provides valuable hints.

_But I know every rock, and tree, and creature, has a life, has a spirit, has a name._

```{quantum-board}
{
  "cols": 4,
  "rows": 3,
  "cells": [
    {
      "coord": { "x": 0, "y": 1 },
      "element": "Laser",
      "rotation": 0,
      "frozen": true
    },
    {
      "coord": { "x": 2, "y": 1 },
      "element": "Rock",
      "rotation": 0,
      "frozen": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Basic

If a photon hits a rock, it is gone.

## In-game

You may say that "this Rock blocks light and make some easy levels much more difficult".
This Rock is your mentor and your guide into the quantum realm. Listen to their pieces of advice carefully.
